# TEAM-FURY-DESIGN-DOCUMENTATION #

   **INTRODUCTION**


**PURPOSE**


 - The purpose of this document is to describe the design operations required by the Team Fury Design group and the manner in which they were fulfilled.
 
 
**SOFTWARES USED**

- FIGMA

- ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS

**DESIGN OVERVIEW**

**GROUP DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**


- Five YouTube guide videos. Go to digital ocean or any other company that writes a lot of technical content. Your designers will design a lovely intro for the video, and you will build a great, video version of the guide. For example, you can do 'How to install Apache on Ubuntu'. It has a great (animated) intro, and looks really good. Someone makes a great screenshare explaining everything (in a clear accent). The video will be given to our designers. If they like the design, they will upload to HNG channel. The number of views you get before Saturday midnight counts as a download. - MARK
